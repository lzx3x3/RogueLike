# RogueLike [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/okkindel/roguelike/badge/master)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/okkindel/roguelike/overview/master)
A roguelike game made becuase of boredom during the exam session.
The game is entirely written in Java and JavaFX, graphics is basically also my work.
It is quite difficult so I wish good luck :)

Please feel free to fork and make comments/suggestions! Thanks!
